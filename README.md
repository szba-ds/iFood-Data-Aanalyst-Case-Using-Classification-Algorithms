# iFood Data Analyst Case - Classification Project


## Introduction
This project was developed as a solution for the iFood Data Analyst Case (2014). The case details and raw data are included in this repository to provide context and understanding of the problem.

The objective of this project is to implement classification algorithms that maximize profits based on a custom profit function. Four different classifiers were created and evaluated:

-RandomForestClassifier
-RandomForestClassifier with SMOTE
-Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
-Gradient Boosting


##Project Structure
preprocessing.ipynb → Handles data cleaning, preprocessing, and basic exploratory analysis to prepare the dataset for modeling.

classifiers.ipynb → Contains the implementation and evaluation of the classifiers based on the defined profit function.

The models are assessed using key performance metrics to determine the most effective approach for profit optimization.
